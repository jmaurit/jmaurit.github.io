    <h1>Christmas Letter 2020</h1>

    <p>Dear family and friends,</p>

    <p>Yet another year has come and gone... and this one has been a real stinker. But we thought we would again give a little update on our little family.</p>

    <p>Bo is three years old, and he is good at doing what three year olds do: Attempting and often succeeding in breaking every rule his parents try to make in the house. He alternates between being a todler, dependent of his cherished parents, and a full-blown "threenager" who wants to do everything himself and can't wait to move out.</p>

    <p>Bo goes to preschool most weekdays, and for the most part enjoys his days playing, learning and occasionally melting down at his school. His social life has started to become more involved and he often wants to invite his friends over to play. This can be tricky, because he likes playing with his friends, but would prefer that they not touch any of his toys.</p>

    <p>Johannes and Bo have started a tradition of going to the swimming pool every Friday after school. And while going to an indoor place with many other people may seem to be unwise in the time of Corona, being mostly submerged in chlorine water most of the time makes up for some of that.</p>

    <p>Like many families who have found themselves spending a lot more time at home, we also considered getting a furry addition to our family this year. But instead of getting our own dog or cat, we decided to put out the word that we would be happy to take care of other people's pets for a few days at a time. So in the last half-year we have been visited by Nico-the black lab mix, Chip-the giant siberian husky, Wilma-the pint sized Danish-Swedish farm dog, and Macaroni-the yellow Canary.</p>

    <p>Siri turned fourty this year. But she is taking a cue from the US president and denying it completely. Happy thirty-tenth birthday Siri! Siri still works with internationalisation and student exchange, and well, business has been slow lately. But she still manages to find things to do. She and her colleague started a podcast about internationalisation and she is working out the logistics of receiving the spring's international students who will be welcomed with 10 days of mandatory quarantine. Fun-and completly true-fact: The hotel that the students will be quarantined in is located in the village of Hell, right next to the airport.</p>

    <p>Johannes still teaches at a business school, because, like they say: For those that can't, teach! Johannes has been lucky to have been able to teach mostly in-person this semester. But he also has learned some online-teaching tricks, thus you are invited to take the online quiz below to see how much of this letter you have absorbed.</p>

    <p>We wish you a Merry Christmas and a vastly improved 2021!</p>

    <p>One-meter-apart-air-hugs,</p>

    <p>Bo, Siri and Johannes</p>
